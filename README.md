# crop-yield-predictor
 This project is a Crop Yield Prediction System that helps farmers and agricultural enthusiasts predict the yield of various crops based on user input. The system takes crop name as input and provides relevant suggestions regarding the best soil type, suitable locations, ideal temperature, and the right season or month for planting the crop. The project aims to support farmers in making informed decisions to optimize their crop production and minimize the risk of failure.  The backend of the project is built using Flask, while the frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interactive user input. Predictions are based on a predefined dataset and can be expanded with more data for better accuracy. The project also uses Times New Roman font for an elegant design, and CSS animations are added to enhance user interaction.
